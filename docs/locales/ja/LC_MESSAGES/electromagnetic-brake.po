"Some stepper motors are made with an electromagnetic brake built-in. "
"Typically, stepper motors have a holding torque which holds loads even "
"when stopped; however, when power is lost, the holding force is lost and "
"the suspended load will fall."

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/about.rst:20
msgid ""
"An electromagnetic brake is a device that locks the shaft of a motor and "
"only releases when the shaft is energized. In the event of a power "
"failure to the motor, the brake will immediately lock the shaft which "
"prevents the load from moving or falling. Vertically moving loads should "
"especially consider using one of these devices."

msgid ""
"When using a stepper motor with an electromagnetic brake, it is necessary"
" to release/lock the brake depending on the status of the motor. This "
"brake add-on board is designed to be controlled in conjunction with the "
"STEP400 motor controller."

msgid "Brake Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/commands.rst:9
msgid ""
"To use the electromagnetic brake, brake mode must first be activated. To "
"do this, send the command ``/enableElectromagnetBrake`` or from the "
"config tool under ``Electromagnetic brake enable``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/commands.rst:13
msgid ""
"If the mode is enabled, the brake will be controlled according to the "
"motors' excitation state."

msgid "Switching States"
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/commands.rst:20
msgid ""
"With the command ``/activate``, you can switch the excitation state of "
"the motor. The brake will be released when the motor is excited and "
"engage when the motor is not excited."

"The overlapping time ``Brake Transition Duration`` can be set from "

"Any load will be releasing when the holding torque on it is lost. "
"However, there are cases where this behavior is desired. To do this, the "
"command ``/free`` can be sent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/commands.rst:36
msgid ""
"Be very careful when sending this command. It is dangerous while any load"
" is still attached to the motor! Ensure the load is safed before sending "
"this command!"

"While the EM brake is engaged, the motion commands ``/run``, ``/goTo``, "
"and ``/move`` are not executed. Instead, the error "
"``ERROR_BRAKE_ENGAGED`` message will be raised."

"Commands that put the motor into a non-excited state (torque hold "
"released) will behave as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/commands.rst:53
msgid ""
"``/softHiZ``: Decelerate the motor to a stop, engage the brake, then "
"release the motor (HiZ state)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/commands.rst:54
msgid ""
"``/hardHiZ``: Stop the motor immediately, engage the brake, thenrelease "
"the motor (HiZ state)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/commands.rst:56
msgid ""
"``/softStop`` and ``/hardStop`` have no change in behavior and will "
"operate like normal. The brake is not engaged when these commands are "
"sent and the motor is kept excited."
