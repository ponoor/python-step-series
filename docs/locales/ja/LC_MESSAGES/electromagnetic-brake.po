"Some stepper motors are made with an electromagnetic brake built-in. "
"Typically, stepper motors have a holding torque which holds loads even "
"when stopped; however, when power is lost, the holding force is lost and "
"the suspended load will fall."

"An electromagnetic brake is a device that locks the shaft of a motor and "
"only releases when the shaft is energized. In the event of a power "
"failure to the motor, the brake will immediately lock the shaft which "
"prevents the load from moving or falling. Vertically moving loads should "
"especially consider using one of these devices."

"When using a stepper motor with an electromagnetic brake, it is necessary"
" to release/lock the brake depending on the status of the motor. This "
"brake add-on board is designed to be controlled in conjunction with the "
"STEP400 motor controller."
