"Some stepper motors are made with an electromagnetic brake built-in. "
"Typically, stepper motors have a holding torque which holds loads even "
"when stopped; however, when power is lost, the holding force is lost and "
"the suspended load will fall."

msgid ""
"An electromagnetic brake is a device that locks the shaft of a motor and "
"only releases when the shaft is energized. In the event of a power "
"failure to the motor, the brake will immediately lock the shaft which "
"prevents the load from moving or falling. Vertically moving loads should "
"especially consider using one of these devices."

"When using a stepper motor with an electromagnetic brake, it is necessary"
" to release/lock the brake depending on the status of the motor. This "
"brake add-on board is designed to be controlled in conjunction with the "
"STEP400 motor controller."

"Some stepper motors have an EM brake built-in. In operation, stepper "

"The brake is a device to lock the shaft when power is lost--or when "

"The EM brake locks the axis when the power to the brake is lost. However,"
" this mechanism is not instant and requires a slight amount of time to "
"engage. This means there must be a duration of time in which the brake "
"and the motor are both engaged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../electromagnetic-brake/submodules/operation.rst:27
msgid ""
"This transition duration, as it is called, does not affect how long it "
"takes for the brake to engage. This duration instead affects how long to "
"wait before releasing or engaging the motor after the brake. The initial "
"value of this overlap time is set to 100ms in the STEP400. It can also be"
" configured using the command ``/setBrakeTransitionDuration`` or from the"
" config tool."
