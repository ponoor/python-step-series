"Welcome to the documentation for ``python-step-series``! Read this page "

msgid ""
"``python-step-series`` is a library built to provide an easy-to-use "
"programmatic interface for configuring and controlling motors using the "
"STEP400 or STEP800. As stated in the ``STEP400/STEP800`` tutorial, there "
"are other third-party applications that can be used to perform the same "
"actions that this library does."

"By the end of this tutorial, you'll have installed the library and "

"This section is only applicable for end-users of this library. Aspiring "

"The recommended method of installing ``python-step-series`` is using "
"Python's ``pip`` in a ``virtualenv``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../python-step-series.rst:42
msgid ""
"And that is it! You can verify the installation by merely importing the "
"library:"

"New terminals will not have your virtualenv active. You'll need to rerun "

"As stated before, ``python-step-series`` strives to be as easy-to-use as "
"possible. For example, it takes four lines of code to establish "
"communication with either device:"

"Sending ``commands.SetDestIP()`` is required each time you establish "

msgid "Understanding Commands and Responses"
msgstr ""

#: ../../python-step-series.rst:87
msgid ""
"``Commands`` are used to control the device whereas ``Responses`` are "
"returned by the device. The library presents both as dataclass objects to"
" give you what is essentially a template to fill or a structured "
"response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../python-step-series.rst:92

"Commands exist in the ``commands`` module of the library, hence why we "

msgid "Using Callbacks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../python-step-series.rst:99
msgid ""
"``python-step-series`` provides support for a callback architectured "
"application. You can \"bind\" callbacks, or multiple callbacks, to a "
"response which will then be called when it is sent by a device."

#: ../../python-step-series.rst:103
msgid "For example:"

#: ../../python-step-series.rst:128
msgid "You can also bind all responses to a callback:"

#: ../../python-step-series.rst:146

"The callback API of ``python-step-series`` allows you to be as simple or "
"complex as you need. The possibilities are virtually endless."

"We hope this short tutorial has given you a nice overview of what the "
